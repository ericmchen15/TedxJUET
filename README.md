# TEDxJUET

Welcome to the TEDxJUET GitHub repository! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our project. Below, you'll find all the information you need to get started.

## About TEDxJUET

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created TEDx, a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience, centered around a specific theme. TEDx events are independently organized, aiming to gather thinkers, innovators, and artists in one place to promote "Ideas Worth Spreading."

**TEDxJUET** is a unique event that brings the TED experience to Guna. It's a curated, day-long, immersive experience that brings together speakers, artists, and an engaged audience. The purpose is to share diverse perspectives, spark deep discussions, and inspire positive connections and impactful actions around ideas that truly matter. Our goal is to provide a platform where thinkers, visionaries, and learners can give talks on a wide range of idea-focused topics, fostering learning, meaningful conversations, and inspiration for others.
